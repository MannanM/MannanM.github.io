### [AWS CodeCommit + Trello/Assembla Integration](https://github.com/MannanM/aws-lambda-codecommit-push-lambda)

If you are using AWS's CodeCommit for your source control, you will often want to automatically update tickets or cards when a new commit is made. You can do this by creating a AWS Lambda function that is triggered when a CodeCommit push occurs. The Lambda can then retrieve the commit message, and if provided with enough information, can automatically update the ticket for you.
